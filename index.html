  <h1>Welcome To My Sytudent-Athlete And Sports Medicine Performance And Outreach Website!</h1>
  <p>I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera, a former soccer player at the University of San Francisco and alumni with a degree in Kinesiology and Health Studies. In college, I found myself a lot
    of the time on the bench, so I've created this website where players can tell their stories for the proper coaches to hear it and enroll in the correct school and soccer
    program. If you've been a successful soccer player in high school and have not been contacted by the colleges or universities that you want, then I suggest you enroll at your
    local community college until you have the full support of your entire family behind you. That means that they must attend most of your community soccer games before you
    transfer to a 4 year university soccer program. Please consider the number of professinal soccer players that your university has produced throughout its years, and also cosider
    the race of the students and coaches at that university. Racism has gotten more complex throughout its history. Please believe that racism and discriminattion still exists on
    this planet. You can find recent news about racism and descrimination in professional soccer, just search it. Let this be a life lesson that you read about and not personally
    experience.</p>
